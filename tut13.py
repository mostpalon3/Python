# IF Else & Elif

var1 = 6
var2 = 90

var3 = int(input("Enter Your Number\n"))

if var3 > var2 :
    print("Greater")
elif var3 == var2:  #we use elif so there is no need to use if  again since all the if is checked even after the requiremnet is met whereas elif directly skips that process
    print("Equal")
else:
    print("Lesser")
    
list = [4, 2 ,7]
print(15 not in list)
if 4 in list:
    print("Yes it is in the list")
else:
    print("Not in the list")
